# Project Title

## Description of the Project

This program is a point-of-sale application for a Deli. Customers are prompted to place an order, and then pick from
a list of products including Sandwich, Chips, and a Drink. Users build sandwiches with their choice of (toasted) bread
and toppings. When finished ordering, users will be prompted to check out, where they can confirm their order. When confirmed,
a receipt is saved to a txt file. Each order creates a new receipt with the current date/time.

## User Stories

User stories that guided the development of this application.

- As an owner, I'd like receipts to be saved so that I have a history of my business transactions.
- As a customer, I'd like to fully customize my sandwich and order so that I may tailor my dining experience to myself.
- As a customer, I'd like a full receipt of my order so that I know exactly what I got and for how much I got it.
- As a customer, I'd like a confirmation screen before my order is finalized so that I can avoid any potential mistakes.
- As an owner, I'd like customers to be charged extra when they order extra meat/cheese so that I don't immediately run out of stock without making a few extra dollars.
